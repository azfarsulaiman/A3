					With this sketch design, I wanted to explore how might clustering age levels depict information and create avenues for enhanced storytelling from the dataset and still answer the above question. I wanted to expand on the expressiveness types we learned in class such as marks, colors and spatial regions to represent the dataset, which add different dimensions and express data eloquently. I aimed for a visualization design that provided quantitative (ratio) comparisons for inter-year, inter-gender and intra-gender data types. Within each gender, it also depicts the age mix of population through clusters. For example, in addition to depicting what each cluster constituted the design also depicts that in 1900, greater than 75% of the population were children or young adults while in 2000 this mix was more spread out with bins of senior years increasing comparatively too. Clustering is a powerful and I had hoped that the design would show respective trends to be highlighted along with quantitative estimations, which this representation supports quite well. Data is ultimately a tool for storytelling and this design enables diverse narratives to be built from one representation. A drawback might be that it inundates the viewer with a lot of information on a single page with different colors and four pie charts that might be overwhelming to read through in a first glance. It’s also difficult to fit all information clearly as numbers and ratio for Super Senior cluster for e.g., difficult to add in the chart.
