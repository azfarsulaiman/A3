			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/Sketch_1.jpg" alt="Line Chart" width = "625" height = "550" />
				<figcaption>
					The graph encodes the total population for males and females for each age in the years 1900 and 2000. In the 1900s, there is a decreasing trend in both male and female populations, with males outnumbering females until the 80+ age groups, where female populations surpass male numbers.

					For the 2000s, the trend is reversed, as the populations of both sexes increase in the earlier years, with males outnumbering females. However, there's a dramatic shift in the 40-45 year old groups, after which there's a steep decline in populations, and female numbers surpass those of males.
					
					There's a noticeable bump in the numbers of 75-year-old females, after which both populations continue their downward trend.				</figcaption>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For a dataset with three dimensions (age, sex, and year), this visualization is straightforward and simple, yet comprehensive enough to fully answer how the age-wise population mix of males and females in the US has changed in the years 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>This sketch is a common technique, generally used to display population datasets and I used common color themes such as pink and red for females in 1900 and 200 respectively while grewen and blue for males in 1900 and 2000 respectively. </li>
				<li>My design choice for the sketch was to use simple yet effective visualization techniques to understand underlying patterns in the dataset to lay the creative and visual foundations for subsequent sketches.</li>
			</ul> 

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sktech_3.jpg" alt="Pie Charts" width = "625" height = "750" />
				<figcaption>
					The pie-chart shows the scale and quantitative (ratio) comparisons for inter-year, inter-gender and age clusters. Both the total and percentage-wise shares are given. Ages have been have been aggregated and bracketed under the life stage they represent (Child, Young Adult, Middle Age, Senior and Super Senior). 
					We can observe that populations for each age cluster has grown in 2000 compared to 1900. Also the share of Child bracket has reuced and the proportionate share of other brackets has increased.  				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Clustering is a powerful technique and bracketing the age groups (aggregating the respective populations) allows for both quantitative and visual comparative representations via anchoring the two years under observation.</li>
				<li>Through pie charts, I was able to consider the three dimensions and include additional information such as total, percentage-wise shares and transform the dataset for storytelling insights to be drawn.</li>
				<li>Additionally, the focus was also to experiment with different marks, labels, categories and still answer the question on population mix.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/Sketch_4.jpg" alt="Heartbeats" width = "625" height = "800" />
				<figcaption>
			The figure depicts the female and male populations over the years 1900 and 2000. FIgure 1 color scheme is used to depict the sexes across the two years and Figure 2 age clusters are used. Male Population is on the bottom vertical axis and female population is on top. Age clusters are displayed below to correspond with respective life stage. We can observe that high trends start off in earlier age groups which then steadily decrease. Considering each color in isolation, we are able to imagine the trend decrease throughout the different age groups. Similar to findings in Figure 1, aggregated male and female populations in 1900 decrease over the age groups. However, for aggregatd male and female populations in 2000, they hold steady across Child and Young Adult (0-35 yrs) groups for males and upto Middle Age groups (0-55 yrs) for females, before significiantly dropping.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My main motivation was to challenge convention and creatively reimagine life journey and population trends as heartbeat readings from an ECG monitor while still building on color, mark, and clustering choices from my previous sketches. </li> 
				<li>Colored lines were depicted in an nnovative way across the horizontal axis to enable such heartrate representaions.</li>
				<li>Red and pink color also helped to communicate this effectively as ECG readings while blue and green are also frequently used  but were chosen for males and flipped to the bottom vertical axis as convetionally male datasets are represented first. </li>
				<li>The grid-like background of the paper I was using also came in handy to effectively represent this.</li>
				<li>Additionally, this dataset is concerned with human population and I wanted to use a style that also conveys the humanistic attribute of the dataset.  </li>
				<li>Since the dataset is simple and straightforward, it is challenging to experiment with out-of-the-box design choices while still enabling informational insights to be drawn.</li> 
				<li>Hence, I believe I was able to balance multiple and contrasting objectives.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
I was interested in answering the question <b><i>How does the age-wise population mix of males and females in the U.S. compare in the years 1900 vs 2000?</i></b> Given the dataset, I wanted to explore how differently and effectively can I visualize this information.
The dataset for this assignment was presumably simple. 
However, I understood the remarkable importance of challenging conventions and creatively think through visualization techniques to inform storytelling.
My favorites, in the following order were, Figure 3, then Figure 2 and finally Figure 1. Each served a different purpose to capture and enable diverse narratives while still answering the question. Figure 1's purpose was to be an initial foray and help me identify basic trends. While successful on that front, it remained less useful than other visualization designs as it didnt reimagine any underlying information to enable further conclusions to be drawn. Figure 2 allowed me to bin age data into clusters and provided a richer perspective than what I observed from Figure 1.
I was also able to add total, percentage-wise and aggregated information to the Figure 2 visualization, something which I found difficult in both Figures 1 and 3. It can also promote further areas of research. For example, a future area of study could be how the Child cluster has decreased in share from 1900 but the share of Middle-Age, Senior and Super Senior has drastically changed. This may be due to better health conditions and longer mortality rates
 
A drawback for Figure 2 might be that it inundates the viewer with a lot of information on a single page with different colors and four pie charts that might be overwhelming to read through in a first glance. It’s also difficult to fit all information clearly as numbers and ratio for Super Senior cluster for e.g., difficult to add in the chart. For Figure 2, its also harder to effectively visualize comparisons since the the age clusters do not have the same starting point. in Figure 1, 1900 population is too small across the individual ages to compare male and female numbers.
Even though Year 1900 and 2000 were static, through Figures 1 and 3, I was able to convey the evolutionary aspect across the ages, something that was missing in Figure 2.   
Figure 3 is an overall improvement on Figure 1, allowing the reader to take away the change in population trends across the years, which was my main question under consideration while still involving innovative tchniques. 
It also encourages a greater need than Figure 2 regarding exploring population trends and causes as they have real life consequences. With Figure 3, I was able to evoke emotion and engagement, something we've been discussing in our reading groups. It allowed me to extend beyond convention as seen by the flipped axes for the male and females,  utilize elements from previous figures and majorly acieve their objectives. 
My only concern is that such depiction might be controversial or morbid, distracting away from the underlying question I wanted my audience to answer with my technique. The use of blue and green colors numbs some of this affect and allows still to be read as a chart. 
However, Figure 3 clearly stands out form the designs. Perhaps we can find ways that are more relevant for anlyzing such information and bringing in the positives of Figures 1, 2,and 3.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				Simplicity, I have found, is a powerful tool to seamlessly communicate design. 
				It served as an important guiding principle for my design choices in A3 to utilize readers’ existing mental models. 
				I wanted my chart to effectively answer the question posed, while still leaving room for diverse interpretation. 
				By focusing on how the trend evolves in my visualization across different buckets, I sought to encourage deeper research in the why aspect, referenced as “Explain the Data” in this week’s readings. 
				The data, straightforward as it was, I wanted to be expressed immensely and information to be easily perceived. Hence, I utilized the classic population pyramid but transformed it to enable richer comparisons and interpretations.       </p>
			<p> 		My intention was to use the pyramid to target accessibility and interpretation by a wider audience and I  enhanced my visualization with certain design encodings. First, I binned the data into 5 age clusters (Child, Young Adult, Middle Age, Senior and Super Senior) to enable shared insights for classes sharing characteristics. Also, this approach would keep the chart simple, effective and prominently highlight trends. Next priority was to effectively utilize the space. Reflecting on lectures, I used conventions to facilitate eye-reading and perspectives. The x-axis span represented U.S. population with females on the left of the y-axis and males on the right to contrast the two. The age clusters were denoted on the y-axis and on left-most side for progression and bottom-up reading of the graph. I kept the gridlines, slightly grayed, with the bars starting at point 0 to serve as benchmark population levels and enable accurate comparisons. Legend, again orthodoxly, was kept on the top-right. Third, I employed bars because they represent aggregation better than any other mark; an important communication choice for population metrics. The series overlap was 50% while the gap width was 150% to allow lumping as per respective age clusters but overlap to simplify comparisons along inter-year and inter-sex dimensions. This can be seen how insignificant it is for 1900s male and female population in Super Senior cluster indicating that clearly something happened that raised population for same demographic in 2000. But I still wanted a certain distinction to be represented hence placed the bars slightly higher/lower for sex. Building on this distinction, I used the conventional colors for sex (albeit stereotypical) with the darker hues for 2000 and lighter for 1900, building on existing mental models. The main focus was to express easier identification of population trends for the reader. Hence, these color choices were taken along with representing all other information (labels, titles, axes) in black.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
	<p> My major question of analysis for the dataset was <b><i> What was the age-wise population mix of maels and females in the years 1900 vs 2000?</i></b></p>
      <p>
		</p>
	<p> 		I was also conscious of enabling further research with my visualization and wanted to depict important quantitative information. Hence, I added labels to the bars to indicate magnitude and nominal numerical. The priority was highlighting ordinal comparisons to be read off the bars, but I included quantitative data labels (lower font to play-down its significance on the reading). Also, since the information has a fixed zero, I also had the choice to include quantitative (ratio) representation but decided against it. I was wary of cognitive load on the reader and didn’t want to overwhelm with too information, just down-played its significance to still leave the door open for anyone interested in diving deep in my design. The titles, labels and legend were hence suitably named to supplement this philosophy. I crafted these choices to allow easier trend representations to emerge, anticipating a pyramid shape for the visual trends represented by the scale and extent of bars  across age clusters, encouraging further reflection on why, for the respective genders a century apart.
	</p>	
	<p> 		The A1 sketches quite significantly impacted my design for this assignment. Sketching and prototyping encourages ideation and in my 3 sketches I purposefully sought to creatively explore different representations. This was a much-needed exercise as I traditionally enjoy sketching or writing my ideas out on a piece of paper before transferring to a digital workspace. Using the design framework, I diverged with A1 and sought to converge with A2 to deeply explore the options and visualizations I could create. I combined ideas from both Sketch 2 and Sketch 3 of A1 which led me to the pyramid design to communicate the population shifts and represent female/male demarcation along the axis, even though this wasn’t an idea I experimented with in A1. From A1, I arrived at transforming age data into clusters for richer representation and inclusion of quantitative information to supplement visual marks. That is where the similarities rested but I was able to generate ideas from this exercise that broke off from my earlier iterations. I was inclined towards line charts with multiple color representations but with this assignment, I recognized that bar graphs convey magnitude and allow for easier comparison and utilized color hues for conveying similarity with subtle distinction. With A1 sketch, I realized that information overload is a factor as I sought to depict quantitative, ratio and ordinal information on same chart. Hence, for A2 I narrowed the scope of the question I wanted to address  and made smarter choices to focus on the message I wanted to communicate with my design.
