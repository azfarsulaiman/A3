				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> I wanted to start by a classic representation of the data, one that usually comes to mind and that can be benchmarked for the other sketches to assess dataset of this type. The graph encodes the total population for males and females for each age in the years 1900 and 2000 and trends which I had hoped the graph could communicate succinctly to help respective inferences and narratives.</li>
				<li>The visualization is simple and straightforward, which in my opinion is what makes it so powerful and effective in answering the posed question. It is able to express the magnitude of population sizes and simultaneously, the relative comparison and trends.</li>
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/sktech_3.jpg" alt="Pie Charts" width = "625" height = "750" />
				<figcaption>
					I wanted to explore how might clustering age levels depict information and create avenues for enhanced storytelling from the dataset and still answer the above question. I wanted to expand on the expressiveness types we learned in class such as marks, colors and spatial regions to represent the dataset, which add different dimensions and express data eloquently.I aimed for a visualization design that provided quantitative (ratio) comparisons for inter-year, inter-gender and intra-gender data types. Within each gender, it also depicts the age mix of population through clusters. For example, in addition to depicting what each cluster constituted the design also depicts that in 1900, greater than 75% of the population were children or young adults while in 2000 this mix was more spread out with bins of senior years increasing comparatively too. 				</figcaption>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Clustering is a powerful and I had hoped that the design would show respective trends to be highlighted along with quantitative estimations, which this representation supports quite well.</li>
				<li> Data is ultimately a tool for storytelling and this design enables diverse narratives to be built from one representation. </li>
				<li>A drawback might be that it inundates the viewer with a lot of information on a single page with different colors and four pie charts that might be overwhelming to read through in a first glance. It’s also difficult to fit all information clearly as numbers and ratio for Super Senior cluster for e.g., difficult to add in the chart.</li>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
I was interested in answering the question <b><i>How does the age-wise population mix of males and females in the U.S. compare in the years 1900 vs 2000?</i></b> Given the dataset, I wanted to explore how differently and effectively can I visualize the information to depict age-wise mix of U.S. male and female populations in the years 1900 and 2000.
The dataset for this assignment was quite simple, however it has shown the remarkability of visual representation in conveying the same information distinctly and vividly, based on the respective intention. I would rank Sketch 3, then 2 and 1 in effectiveness and diversity of addressing the posed question above. Sketch 2 enables the development of diverse narratives while still answering the question and is a better aid in visualizing patterns within the data; a domain where other designs are found significantly wanting. Grouping the ages provides a rich perspective of analyzing data compared to designs 1 and 3. 
However, for Sketch 3, the circular nature of the chart might doesn’t leverage a standard reference point, making rapid comparisons for segments difficult to draw especially when they’re so close to each other (27 and 28%). This might increase cognitive load on the user, especially given the information inundation. Sketches 1 and 3 circumvent this by providing a standard reference point. Sketch 1 particularly, overcomes the weaknesses of Sketch 3 and would easily be the most popular and crisp representation of the given dataset as it allows quick inferences to be drawn, while simultaneously highlighting any anomalies such as the sudden climb in female population aged 70 in 2000. Sketch 3 focus on net change from 1900 can be useful in conducting point comparisons for ages and identifying granularly areas of concern or further research for the viewer at a level that is not easily gained from the other designs. However, its limited scope is also its biggest disadvantage.
I would still advocate for Sketch 3 and the information inundation challenges can be overcome with advanced interactive visualization tools that reduce/highlight respective information as per the viewers discretion. Perhaps designs 1 and 2 can be combined in such interactive visualization designs with Sketch 1 leading the user to sketch 2 for a more refined interpretation of data, based on the purpose.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				Simplicity, I have found, is a powerful tool to seamlessly communicate design. 
				It served as an important guiding principle for my design choices in A3 to utilize readers’ existing mental models. 
				I wanted my chart to effectively answer the question posed, while still leaving room for diverse interpretation. 
				By focusing on how the trend evolves in my visualization across different buckets, I sought to encourage deeper research in the why aspect, referenced as “Explain the Data” in this week’s readings. 
				The data, straightforward as it was, I wanted to be expressed immensely and information to be easily perceived. Hence, I utilized the classic population pyramid but transformed it to enable richer comparisons and interpretations.       </p>
			<p> 		My intention was to use the pyramid to target accessibility and interpretation by a wider audience and I  enhanced my visualization with certain design encodings. First, I binned the data into 5 age clusters (Child, Young Adult, Middle Age, Senior and Super Senior) to enable shared insights for classes sharing characteristics. Also, this approach would keep the chart simple, effective and prominently highlight trends. Next priority was to effectively utilize the space. Reflecting on lectures, I used conventions to facilitate eye-reading and perspectives. The x-axis span represented U.S. population with females on the left of the y-axis and males on the right to contrast the two. The age clusters were denoted on the y-axis and on left-most side for progression and bottom-up reading of the graph. I kept the gridlines, slightly grayed, with the bars starting at point 0 to serve as benchmark population levels and enable accurate comparisons. Legend, again orthodoxly, was kept on the top-right. Third, I employed bars because they represent aggregation better than any other mark; an important communication choice for population metrics. The series overlap was 50% while the gap width was 150% to allow lumping as per respective age clusters but overlap to simplify comparisons along inter-year and inter-sex dimensions. This can be seen how insignificant it is for 1900s male and female population in Super Senior cluster indicating that clearly something happened that raised population for same demographic in 2000. But I still wanted a certain distinction to be represented hence placed the bars slightly higher/lower for sex. Building on this distinction, I used the conventional colors for sex (albeit stereotypical) with the darker hues for 2000 and lighter for 1900, building on existing mental models. The main focus was to express easier identification of population trends for the reader. Hence, these color choices were taken along with representing all other information (labels, titles, axes) in black.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
	<p> My major question of analysis for the dataset was <b><i> What was the age-wise population mix of maels and females in the years 1900 vs 2000?</i></b></p>
      <p>
		</p>
	<p> 		I was also conscious of enabling further research with my visualization and wanted to depict important quantitative information. Hence, I added labels to the bars to indicate magnitude and nominal numerical. The priority was highlighting ordinal comparisons to be read off the bars, but I included quantitative data labels (lower font to play-down its significance on the reading). Also, since the information has a fixed zero, I also had the choice to include quantitative (ratio) representation but decided against it. I was wary of cognitive load on the reader and didn’t want to overwhelm with too information, just down-played its significance to still leave the door open for anyone interested in diving deep in my design. The titles, labels and legend were hence suitably named to supplement this philosophy. I crafted these choices to allow easier trend representations to emerge, anticipating a pyramid shape for the visual trends represented by the scale and extent of bars  across age clusters, encouraging further reflection on why, for the respective genders a century apart.
	</p>	
	<p> 		The A1 sketches quite significantly impacted my design for this assignment. Sketching and prototyping encourages ideation and in my 3 sketches I purposefully sought to creatively explore different representations. This was a much-needed exercise as I traditionally enjoy sketching or writing my ideas out on a piece of paper before transferring to a digital workspace. Using the design framework, I diverged with A1 and sought to converge with A2 to deeply explore the options and visualizations I could create. I combined ideas from both Sketch 2 and Sketch 3 of A1 which led me to the pyramid design to communicate the population shifts and represent female/male demarcation along the axis, even though this wasn’t an idea I experimented with in A1. From A1, I arrived at transforming age data into clusters for richer representation and inclusion of quantitative information to supplement visual marks. That is where the similarities rested but I was able to generate ideas from this exercise that broke off from my earlier iterations. I was inclined towards line charts with multiple color representations but with this assignment, I recognized that bar graphs convey magnitude and allow for easier comparison and utilized color hues for conveying similarity with subtle distinction. With A1 sketch, I realized that information overload is a factor as I sought to depict quantitative, ratio and ordinal information on same chart. Hence, for A2 I narrowed the scope of the question I wanted to address  and made smarter choices to focus on the message I wanted to communicate with my design.
